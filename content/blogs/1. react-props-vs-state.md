### Introduction

In React, props and state are fundamental concepts that determine how data flows in an application. Understanding their differences helps in writing better components.

### What are Props?

Props (short for properties) allow components to receive data from their parent components. They are read-only and cannot be modified within the component.

```ts
const Greeting = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

### What is State?

State is used to manage data that changes within a component. Unlike props, state is mutable and can be updated using the useState hook.

```ts
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
};
```

### Key Differences

1. Props are immutable, while state is mutable.
2. Props are passed from parent to child, while state is managed within a component.
3. Props enable reusability, while state is used for dynamic behavior.

### Conclusion

Both props and state are essential in React. Use props for passing data and state for managing dynamic changes within a component.
