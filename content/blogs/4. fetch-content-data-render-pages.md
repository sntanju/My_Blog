### Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way to structure your code so it’s easier to understand and manage. C++ is one of the most popular programming languages that supports OOP. In this blog, we’ll walk through the four main concepts of OOP — classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

### Step 1: What is a Class and Object?

A class is like a template or blueprint. An object is a real instance of that class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    string model;

    void drive() {
        cout << "Driving " << brand << " " << model << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.model = "Corolla";
    myCar.drive();

    return 0;
}
```
Here, Car is the class, and myCar is the object created from it.
### Step 2: Configure Nuxt Content v2

Once the dependencies are installed, you need to configure Nuxt Content v2 in your Nuxt 3 project. To do this, create a new file named nuxt.config.js in the root directory of your project and add the following code:

```js
export default {
  // Enable Nuxt Content module
  modules: [
    '@nuxt/content'
  ],

```

In the above code, we have enabled the Nuxt Content module and set the directory where your content will be stored.

### Step 3: Create content files

Once Nuxt Content v2 is configured, you can create content files in the specified directory. By default, Nuxt Content v2 supports Markdown and YAML file formats. You can create a new file in the `content` directory with the following structure:

```md
---
title: 'Hello, world!'
---

# Welcome to Nuxt Content v2

This is an example of a Markdown file created using Nuxt Content v2.
```

In the above code, we have created a Markdown file with a title and a sample content.

### Step 4: Display content on a page

Now that we have created content files, we can display the content on a page. To do this, create a new Vue component in the components directory with the following code:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { path } = useRoute()
const articles = await queryContent(path).findOne()
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <div>
      <ContentRenderer :value="articles">
        <template #empty>
          <p>No content found.</p>
        </template>
      </ContentRenderer>
    </div>
  </main>
</template>
```
