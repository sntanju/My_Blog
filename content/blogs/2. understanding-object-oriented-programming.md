### Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way to structure your code so it’s easier to understand and manage. C++ is one of the most popular programming languages that supports OOP. In this blog, we’ll walk through the four main concepts of OOP — classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

### What is a Class and Object?

A class is like a template or blueprint. An object is a real instance of that class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    string model;

    void drive() {
        cout << "Driving " << brand << " " << model << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.model = "Corolla";
    myCar.drive();

    return 0;
}
```
Here, Car is the class, and myCar is the object created from it.
### Encapsulation

Encapsulation means hiding the internal data and allowing access only through public methods.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class BankAccount {
private:
    int balance;

public:
    BankAccount(int initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount account(1000);
    account.deposit(500);
    cout << "Balance: " << account.getBalance() << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

Here, the balance variable is private. It can only be accessed through deposit() and getBalance() methods.

### Inheritance

Inheritance lets you create new classes based on existing ones.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    void speak() {
        cout << "Animal speaks" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog dog;
    dog.speak(); 

    return 0;
}

```
Dog is a subclass of Animal, and it overrides the speak() method.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows the same function to behave differently based on the object.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() {
        cout << "Animal speaks" << endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        cout << "Cat meows" << endl;
    }
};

class Cow : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        cout << "Cow moos" << endl;
    }
};

void makeSound(Animal* a) {
    a->speak();
}

int main() {
    Cat cat;
    Cow cow;

    makeSound(&cat); // Cat meows
    makeSound(&cow); // Cow moos

    return 0;
}
```

Using virtual, we achieve runtime polymorphism.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is about hiding the complex details and only showing the necessary parts.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual float getArea() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    float radius;

public:
    Circle(float r) {
        radius = r;
    }

    float getArea() override {
        return 3.14 * radius * radius;
    }
};

int main() {
    Circle c(5);
    cout << "Area of circle: " << c.getArea() << endl;

    return 0;
}

```
Here, Shape is an abstract class. Circle provides its own version of getArea().

### Conclusion
OOP in C++ helps in organizing your code better. We covered the core principles: Classes & Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. Understanding these basics is the first step toward writing clean and maintainable code. Practice these concepts by writing small programs—it’s the best way to learn!
