### Introduction

SQL is not just about writing SELECT * FROM table. As you go deeper, you’ll find many powerful features like functions, procedures, grouping, joins, control flow, and transactions that make SQL really powerful.
In this blog, we’ll go through these advanced topics in a simple and easy way. Let’s get started!

### Delimiter in SQL

Normally SQL uses ; to end a command.
But when writing functions or procedures (which have ; inside them), we temporarily change the delimiter.It tells SQL to wait until // is found before ending.

```sql
DELIMITER //

... your code here ...

DELIMITER ;
```

### SQL Functions

Functions are like mini-programs inside SQL. They take input, do some work, and give you back a result.
Example: Create a function to add two numbers
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION add_numbers(a INT, b INT)
RETURNS INT
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
  RETURN a + b;
END //

DELIMITER ;

```

### Stored Procedures

A stored procedure is like saving a group of SQL commands together, so you can run them anytime easily.

Example: Create a procedure to insert a new user
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE add_user(IN username VARCHAR(50), IN age INT)
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO users(name, age) VALUES (username, age);
END //

DELIMITER ;

// Call The Procedure
CALL add_user('John', 25);

```

### Grouping Data (GROUP BY)

Sometimes you want to group rows together and perform calculations like sum, count, etc.

Example: Group employees by department
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

```

### Control Flow (IF, CASE)

SQL can also make decisions using IF and CASE.
IF Example inside a procedure:
```sql 
IF salary > 50000 THEN
  SET bonus = 5000;
ELSE
  SET bonus = 2000;
END IF;

```

CASE Example:
```sql 
SELECT name,
CASE 
  WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
  WHEN salary > 30000 THEN 'Medium Salary'
  ELSE 'Low Salary'
END AS salary_status
FROM employees;

```

### Transactions

Transactions are a way to make sure that a group of operations either all succeed or all fail.
(Useful for banking apps, booking systems, etc.)

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;
```
If something goes wrong, you can ROLLBACK:
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```
### Conclusion

In this blog, we explored some powerful SQL features like functions, delimiters, procedures, grouping, joining, control flow, and transactions.
